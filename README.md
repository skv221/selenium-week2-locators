# Week 2: Element Locators, Form Automation, and Dynamic Content Handling  

This repository contains my work for Week 2 of the **Python Selenium Learning Journey**. The focus was on mastering element locators, performing form automation, handling dynamic web content, and extracting and presenting web table data.  

---

## **Key Tasks and Highlights**  

### **Task 1: Practice Different Locators**  
- Utilized locators such as `id`, `class name`, `name`, `XPath`, and `CSS selectors` to identify and interact with web elements.  
- Explored multiple websites to test element identification across diverse HTML structures.  

### **Task 2: Form Submission with Dynamic Content**  
- Automated the filling and submission of a web form.  
- Integrated **explicit waits** to interact with a dynamically loaded success message post-submission.  

### **Task 3: Extracting and Displaying Web Table Data**  
- Extracted specific columns of data from a web table on a dynamic webpage.  
- Used the **PrettyTable** Python package to display the extracted data in a clean, tabular format for enhanced readability.  

### **Task 4: Automate Search and Results Handling**  
- Automated the process of searching for a keyword on e-commerce platforms and extracted product names and prices from the search results.
- Used the **PrettyTable** Python package to display the extracted data in a clean, tabular format for enhanced readability.

## **How to Run the Scripts**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```  
2. Install the required Python packages:  
   ```bash
   pip install selenium prettytable
   ```  
3. Ensure the correct version of the WebDriver is set up for your browser.  
4. Run the scripts:  
   ```bash
   python <script_name>.py
   ```

## **Key Learnings**  
- Practical use of Selenium locators for flexible web element identification.  
- Automation of form submissions and interaction with dynamically loaded content.  
- Extracting structured data from tables and enhancing its presentation using PrettyTable.  
- Automating e-commerce workflows, including search and results handling.
